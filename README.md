# Wordle_Solver

## A Python-based application with an intuitive Tkinter GUI that uses a custom algorithm to solve Wordle puzzles.

This project was built as a fun exercise to see if I could create an algorithm that could help consistently solve wordle puzzles. The solver runs entirely on Python 3.12.1 with no external dependencies beyond the standard library. This is not a very complex code for showing off my coding ability but it is something I use daily to maintain my wordle streak.
- Algorithm: Uses only built-in Python functions and libraries.
- Interface: Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter.
- Goal: Provide step-by-step guesses to solve any Wordle puzzle.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository
   
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Wordle_Solver.git`
   
   `cd Wordle_Solver`
2. Verify Tkinter is installed (Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions. If itâ€™s missing, install it)

    `sudo apt-get install python3-tk   # Linux`

    `brew install python-tk            # macOS`

3. Run the program
   
     `python Wordle_Calculator.py`

## Requirements:
- Python 3.12.1+
- Tkinter

## Future Improvements:
- Add command-line mode (no GUI).
- Expand word list for better coverage.
